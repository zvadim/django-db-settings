Django Stored Settings
==================

It often happens that we need to be able dynamically to create/edit some settings and site variables, for example site title, logo and counter code.

`stored-settings` module is tailored specifically for these purposes allowing dynamically to create and further on to edit via django-admin records of the following types:

* Char
* Text
* HTML text
* Boolean
* Image



Requirements
------------

Django stored-settings requires Django 1.3 or later and Pillow. Also has TinyMCE integration.

Getting It
-----------
You can get Django stored-settings by using pip or easy_install:

`$ pip install stored-settings`
or
`$ easy_install stored-settings`

If you want to install it from source, grab the git repository from GitHub and run setup.py:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/zvadim/django-stored-settings.git
$ cd stored_settings
$ python setup.py install
```

Installing It
------------

To enable `stored-settings` in your project you need to add it to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your projects `settings.py` file:


```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'stored_settings',
)
```

And also add new content processor

```python
TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
    ...
    'stored_settings.context_processors.stored_settings',
)
```

Last step is db migration

```
$ python manage.py migrate 
```

Using It
---------

See an [example](https://github.com/zvadim/django-stored-settings/tree/master/example "Django stored settings example")

TinyMCE
-------

For HTML fields TinyMCE can be applied. To enable `TinyMCE` support in `stored-settings` you need to add to `settings.py` the following:

```python

STORED_SETTINGS_TINYMCE_ENABLE = True

```
